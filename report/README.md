Grocery Sales Forecasting - Report
==================================

The completed data set contain 125+ millions grocery sale records, because the goal is to forecast the future value. Using data far behind the forecasting date might cause the result unreliable. In this case, we only using the sale records after `2017-01-01` for training purpose. After integrated `train` with `items`, `stores` and `oil`, we got 23+ millions records along with 12 features.

In order to speed up the visulization, this report only using 10% of our integrated train set, that is 2.3 millions records.

#### `unit_sales`

    ##      Min.   1st Qu.    Median      Mean   3rd Qu.      Max. 
    ##     0.017     2.000     4.000     8.179     8.000 10700.000

It suggested most of the item sold less than 10 units per supermarket per day.

#### `date`

The plot suggested strong seasonality in the total unit sale.

#### `store_nbr`: store id.

<img src="plot/plot_store_nbr-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

In general, the median unit sale of 54 store is similiar, the plot suggest `store_nbr` can explain some of variation in `unit_sales`. However, level merging of `store_nbr` might required.

#### `item_nbr`: item id.

<img src="plot/plot_item_nbr-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

    ## [1] 4000

That is 4000 different items, the item id should be consider as factor type, plot in numerical order only in visualization purpose. The plot suggested `item_nbr` can explain a lot varaition of `unit_sales`. However, level merging of `item_nbr` might required.

#### `onpromotion`: wether on promotion.

<img src="plot/plot_onpromotion-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

The plot suggested the unit sales will slightly increased while the item is on promotion.

#### `family`: item family.

<img src="plot/plot_family-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

    ## [1] 33

33 level in `family`, this variable explain lot of variation of `unit_sales`. Consider it is a fatcor variable, level might a bit too much. Since `family` is a feature related to item, we can integrated `family` and `item_nbr` to generate new features via clustering.

#### `class`: item class.

<img src="plot/plot_class-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

    ## [1] 331

That is 331 different item class. The item class should be consider as factor type, plot in numerical order only in visualization purpose. The plot suggested `class` can explain a lot varaition of `unit_sales`.

Since `class` is also a feature related to item, we can integrated `class`, `family` and `item_nbr` to generate new features via item clustering.

#### `perishable`: wether item is perishable.

<img src="plot/plot_perishable-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

In this plot, 1 mean the item is perishable and 0 is the contrast. The plot suggested the perishable item will have a higher sale in units.

#### `city`

<img src="plot/plot_city-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

The supermarket in city Quito have the highest mean unit sales comparing others.

    ## [1] 22

#### `state`

<img src="plot/plot_state-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

    ## [1] 16

That is 22 city in 16 state of this dataset, both of them explain some of the variation in `unit_sales`. However, some of the level share the similar mean in both varaible. Since the number of city only slightly smaller than the number of state, we can integrated `city` and `state` to generate new features.

#### `type`: store type.

<img src="plot/plot_type-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

The item in store type A have the higest mean unit sales and item in store type E have the lowest mean unit sales. The mean unit sale in each store type share the similar value, future level merging for `type` might required.

#### `cluster`: store cluster.

<img src="plot/plot_cluster-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

The plot suggested supermarket in cluster 5, 8, 11 and 14 have a higher mean unit sales than others. Since some of the cluster have the similar mean unit sale, future level merging for `type` might required.

#### `dcoilwtico`: oil price.

<img src="plot/plot_dcoilwtico-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

The plot suggested the mean unit sales is positive associated with the oil price.
